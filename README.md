-# IPBS
-
-Brian Hung. Final Project for Blockchain for Developers, Fall 2017.
-
-## Overview
-
-IPBS - InterPlanetary Banking System - is an Ethereum smart contract that provides the functionality of a bank account without the overhead.
-
-## Basic Implementations
-
-Withdrawals & Deposits: users should be able to withdraw and deposit Ether into their own accounts,
-and if permitted, withdraw and or deposit from other users' accounts.
-
-Multisig Wallet: an account should be accessible by multiple users. Control of Ether funds can be
-structured as flat, where each user has equal voting weight; or tiered, where each user is assigned
-a voting weight from a predefined bucket.
-
-## Additional Features (if Time-permitted)
-
-Frontend Integration: instead of requiring users to direct themselves to an IPFS gateway to view transactions,
-or directly deal with the Ethereum contract, users should be able to use login with a pre-existing supported account
-maintained by a 3rd party (e.g. Google, Facebook, Github) and view and commit transactions.
-
-Experimentation with Tether: USDT, maintained by Bitfinex, is a cryptocurrency which is tethered 1:1 with
-the USD. Instead of riding the waves of Ether, it is possible to stabilize the value of an account?
-
-## Stack
-
-Ethereum: where the contract is operated.
-
-IPFS: everytime a transaction is made within an account, the change will be reflected and stored in an IPFS node
-that is accessible by authorized users of that account.
-
-## ETC.
-
-I'll see how far I get with the multisig wallet :) Also if you're wondering why there's a folder called "Mastodon"
-in this repository, it's because I had a initial idea to have a Twitter clone use IPFS to store tweets, and force
-new users to temporarily deposit Ether into a contract to reduce the amount of spammers / bots -- but that seems
-out of reach given the Gitlet project also assigned to me.
